## Introduction
The code is based on MMSegmentaion v1.2.1.
The repository contains official Pytorch implementations of training and evaluation codes and pre-trained models for MSPPSNet.
## Get_Started
You can easily get started by reading https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/docs/en/get_started.md.
## Prepare datasets
https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/docs/en/user_guides/2_dataset_prepare.md.
## Training and Testing
### Training and testing on a single GPU
~~~python
python tools/train.py configs/msppsnet/MSPPSNet_1xb4_loveda-512x512.py
~~~

```python
python tools/test.py ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} [optional arguments]
```
